webdav-simple
========

A simple embeddable and customizable WebDAV server implementation based on Apache Tomcat code.

Supports storing WebDAV-enabled data in the filesystem (out of box), and can be easily adopted
for any filesystem storage, including virtual (database-backed) filesystem, subversion
repository or something else.

Source code and WAR for a small example application is located in the =examples= folder
